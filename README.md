### Story/Rules:
_Don't Drink The Punch_ is a cult themed card game. Players are tasked with flipping over cards one a time. Each card face has a cult related item or action and text describing it. 

Cards can have four effects: **Earn points**, **lose points**, **gain an extra life**, or **lose a life**.

-Players have an initial score of _0 points_ and _0 extra lives_

-Players click on a card, one at a time, to flip it over and reveal what item/ effect they will recieve.

  _Example: Flipping over a **Bring Your Own Punch** card, gives the player 30 points and an extra life._
  
-The game ends when the player draws a punch card and the life count hits zero.

## Technologies:
-Ruby on Rails 

-JavaScript

## To-Do List:
-The backend database needs to be updated with proper links to the card images.

-Upon fixing the image links, the game's distribution of card types will be better balanced and the game will function as intended.

## Status:
The game is not yet deployed, but will be upon updating the database as stated in the above section.
